# HPE Illustration

Our visual storytelling style is unique and own-able. It elevates our brand and distinguishes us in the marketplace. To allow for storytelling flexibility at HPE, we have created a broad library of tools that can be used to tell a wide range of stories.

Illustrations are used to create compelling and expressive representations of complex brand stories. Our illustration style is defined by simple geometric shapes expressed in a linear fashion. Our illustration set is organized into four categories: people, scenes, concepts, and elements.

HPE Illustrations come in two forms for designers. A **[Adobe Illustrator (.ai) ](https://github.com/hpe-design/icons/blob/master/hpe-simple-icons-1.7.sketch)** format which allows you to manipulate the art and build your own concepts and as **[Individual PNG's ](https://github.com/hpe-design/icons/tree/master/Icons%20-%20SVG)** if you just want to drop an illustration in your app or website as-is.
